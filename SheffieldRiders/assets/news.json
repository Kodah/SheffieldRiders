We may head for a pint afterwards too.  Please note that we will be closing the Steel City Track on both of these evenings, so please do not try and ride them on this nights. These will be the only closures of the track until the day before the race",

  "body": "Can you feel it? There’s more than a hint of spring in the air. Those eternal optimists the weather forecasters reckon things are looking up, there are snowdrops and daffodils everywhere and before you know it, the trails will be snuff dry and running sweet.  But while spring means dry trails for us, for our friends in the conservation business, it means much, much more. Many ground nesting birds are already prospecting for potential homes and we can play a big part in helping them to raise the next generation of skylarks, woodcocks and curlew.  And it couldn’t be simpler. Stay on the trail is all the land managers ask. Going off-piste during the nesting season, roughly March to July, is not in the best interests of the birds or mountain bikers. Most of us love the place we ride and take great pleasure in the wildlife that enliven it. Staying on the trail is no hardship and if it means we get to see more of these fantastic birds, all the better.",
